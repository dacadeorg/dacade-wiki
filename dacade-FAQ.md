Currently, we are focusing on the education of blockchain technology for developers. But we plan to expand to the education of web development too. There is already one community dedicated to this called web development 101.

### What problem does dacade solve?
Through the internet, there is a lot of information available, but access to information doesn‚Äôt guarantee to learn. In most education systems teachers are the ones who facilitate learning. They give feedback, evaluate student's work and curate learning materials. Teachers are often bottlenecks of education systems because they are hard to scale and expensive. On dacade, we are building a peer-learning system where learners educate each other.

Currently not. To build the product as fast as possible, we decided to build it in a centralized way. But it is very important to us that dacade becomes fully decentralized at a certain point. In the first step, we will make the code for the platform open source, hopefully, at the end of 2020.
